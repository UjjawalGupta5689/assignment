# Selenium Login Automation

This project demonstrates a simple login automation script using Selenium in Python. The script navigates to a login page, enters credentials, and checks for successful login.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install Selenium using the following command:

```
pip install selenium

Download ChromeDriver from ChromeDriver downloads page and update the executable_path in the script accordingly.

Usage
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd your-repo
Open the script in a text editor and update the login credentials:

python
username_input.send_keys("your_username")
password_input.send_keys("your_password")
Save the script.

Run the script:


python script_name.py
Script Explanation
The script uses Selenium to automate the login process on a web application. It performs the following steps:

Initializes a Chrome WebDriver.
Navigates to the specified login URL.
Finds username, password input fields, and the login button.
Enters login credentials.
Clicks the login button to submit the form.
Waits for the dashboard page to load.
Checks if the login was successful.
Feel free to customize the script according to your web application's structure and requirements.

Notes
Ensure you handle login credentials securely, and avoid hardcoding sensitive information in scripts.

Update the ChromeDriver path in the script according to your system configuration.

Adjust the wait timeout value based on your web application's loading time.
